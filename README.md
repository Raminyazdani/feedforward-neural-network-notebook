# Feedforward Neural Network Classifier

A PyTorch implementation for multi-class classification using feedforward neural networks.

## Overview

This project implements a 2-layer feedforward neural network to solve classification problems that are not linearly separable.

## Features

- Synthetic data generation (3 classes, 2D space)
- PyTorch implementation
- Training with backpropagation
- Decision boundary visualization
- Hyperparameter experiments

## Setup

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
jupyter notebook feedforward_neural_network.ipynb
```

## Results

- Successfully classifies non-linearly separable data
- Achieves 80-90% accuracy
- Clear decision boundary visualization
- Hyperparameter sensitivity analysis

## Tech Stack

- Python 3.x
- PyTorch
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
