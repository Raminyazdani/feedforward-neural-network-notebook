Ramin Yazdani | Feedforward Neural Network Classifier | main | WIP(experiments): Run baseline training experiment

Conducted the first complete training experiment with baseline hyperparameters to establish
reference performance. This baseline is critical for comparing future experiments.

Baseline configuration (config_0):
- Learning rate: 0.01
- Hidden dimensions: 64
- Epochs: 100
- Batch size: 32

Key results documented:
- Training loss curve (convergence behavior over epochs)
- Training accuracy curve (learning progression)
- Final decision boundaries visualization
- Observed patterns and model behavior

Observations from baseline:
- Model converges smoothly with this learning rate
- Achieves good separation of the three classes
- Decision boundaries look reasonable and smooth
- No signs of severe overfitting or underfitting

Why establish a baseline: Before experimenting with hyperparameters, we need a reference
point. The baseline shows what "normal" training looks like with reasonable default values.
Future experiments will be compared against this baseline to understand how different
hyperparameters affect performance.

Verification: Training completed successfully. Loss decreased consistently, accuracy improved,
and decision boundaries correctly separate the three spiral classes.
