Ramin Yazdani | Feedforward Neural Network Classifier | main | WIP(data): Implement synthetic data generation

Created the initial notebook with data generation functionality for a 3-class classification
problem with non-linearly separable boundaries. This is the foundation - understanding the
problem before building a solution.

Key implementations:
- Created feedforward_neural_network.ipynb notebook
- Added necessary import statements (numpy, matplotlib, torch)
- Implemented generate_data() function creating 3 spiral classes in 2D space
- Added visualization plot showing the non-linear decision boundaries needed

The synthetic data demonstrates why a simple linear classifier (perceptron) would fail and
why we need a multi-layer feedforward network. The visualization clearly shows the three
classes intertwined in a non-linearly separable pattern.

Verification: Data generation works correctly and produces 300 points across 3 classes.
Visualization shows expected spiral pattern confirming non-linear separability.
