# Feedforward Neural Network Classifier

A PyTorch implementation for multi-class classification using feedforward neural networks.

## Overview

This project demonstrates how 2-layer feedforward neural networks can solve classification problems that are not linearly separable.

## Progress

✅ Data generation implemented
✅ Visualization of non-linearly separable 3-class dataset

## Tech Stack

- Python 3.x
- PyTorch
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

## Setup

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
jupyter notebook feedforward_neural_network.ipynb
```

## Current Status

- Generated synthetic 3-class dataset (300 points)
- Visualized data showing non-linear class boundaries
- Ready for DataLoader implementation
