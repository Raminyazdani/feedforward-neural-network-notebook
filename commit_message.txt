Ramin Yazdani | Feedforward Neural Network Classifier | main | WIP(model): Define neural network architecture

Designed the 2-layer feedforward neural network class structure using PyTorch's nn.Module.
This establishes the model architecture that will learn non-linear decision boundaries.

Key implementations:
- Created FFNN class extending nn.Module
- Defined network layers: fc1 (input → hidden) and fc2 (hidden → output)
- Added __init__ method with configurable input, hidden, and output dimensions
- Documented architecture design decisions in notebook

The architecture consists of:
- Input layer: 2 dimensions (x, y coordinates)
- Hidden layer: Configurable size (default 64 neurons)
- Output layer: 3 dimensions (one per class)

A 2-layer network with non-linear activation can approximate complex decision boundaries,
making it suitable for this non-linearly separable classification problem.

Verification: FFNN class instantiates correctly with specified dimensions.
