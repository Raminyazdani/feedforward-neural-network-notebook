Ramin Yazdani | Feedforward Neural Network Classifier | main | WIP(setup): Initialize repository with basic structure

Set up the foundational repository structure with initial README and .gitignore configuration.
This establishes the project identity and basic organization before implementing any code.

Created files:
- README.md: Initial project description outlining the feedforward neural network classifier
- .gitignore: Python and Jupyter-specific ignore patterns to prevent committing artifacts

This commit represents the first step in the development process, establishing a clean
workspace and documenting the project's purpose. The README provides an overview of what
will be built, while the .gitignore ensures only source files are tracked in version control.

Verification: Repository structure is in place and ready for development.
