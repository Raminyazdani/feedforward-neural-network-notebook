# Feedforward Neural Network Classifier

A PyTorch implementation for multi-class classification using feedforward neural networks.

## Progress

✅ Complete implementation
✅ Multiple training experiments
✅ Hyperparameter analysis

## Experiments Completed

1. Baseline (config_0)
2. Lower learning rate (config_1) 
3. High learning rate (config_2)

## Observations

- Learning rate significantly impacts convergence
- Hidden layer size affects model capacity
- Trade-offs between stability and speed

## Next Steps

- Add comprehensive documentation
- Polish for portfolio
