Ramin Yazdani | Feedforward Neural Network Classifier | main | WIP(data): Implement PyTorch DataLoader infrastructure

Implemented PyTorch data handling infrastructure following framework best practices.
This enables efficient batch processing and follows PyTorch conventions for dataset management.

Key implementations:
- Created PointsDataset class extending torch.utils.data.Dataset
- Created PointsDataLoader class extending torch.utils.data.DataLoader
- Added proper tensor conversions (numpy arrays → torch tensors)
- Tested batch processing to ensure data flows correctly

Using PyTorch's Dataset and DataLoader abstractions makes the training code cleaner and
enables features like shuffling, batching, and parallel data loading. This is a standard
pattern in PyTorch development and makes the code more maintainable.

Verification: DataLoader successfully creates batches from generated data. Batch shapes
and types verified to be correct for neural network input.
