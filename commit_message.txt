Ramin Yazdani | Feedforward Neural Network Classifier | main | WIP(docs): Add comprehensive analysis and observations

Added detailed documentation and analysis throughout the notebook, explaining observations,
learning patterns, and insights gained from the experiments. A good notebook explains "why",
not just "what".

Key additions:
- Detailed observation cells analyzing training behavior
- Explanations of learning patterns across different configurations
- Documentation of overfitting vs. underfitting scenarios
- Interpretations comparing the three experimental configurations
- Enhanced markdown cells with clearer explanations

Analysis highlights:
- Explained why certain learning rates work better
- Documented the trade-offs between stability and convergence speed
- Illustrated how hyperparameters affect decision boundary quality
- Provided insights into recognizing and diagnosing training problems

Educational value: The documentation transforms code into a learning resource. Readers can
understand not just what was implemented, but why certain decisions were made and what
insights were gained from experimentation.

This makes the notebook valuable for:
- Portfolio presentation (shows analytical thinking)
- Educational reference (teaches concepts through examples)
- Future reference (documents lessons learned)

Verification: All experiments are thoroughly documented with clear explanations of results
and their implications.
