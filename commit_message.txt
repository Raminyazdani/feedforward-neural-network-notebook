Ramin Yazdani | Feedforward Neural Network Classifier | main | feat(portfolio): Polish notebook for professional presentation

Transformed the working implementation into a portfolio-ready piece with professional
presentation. This step removes all academic/assignment traces and enhances documentation
for public showcase.

Key changes:
- Updated notebook title: "Exercise 5.4" → "Feedforward Neural Network Classifier"
- Cleaned all section headers (removed exercise numbers and point values)
- Enhanced README with comprehensive professional documentation
- Added detailed setup instructions and dependency information
- Added troubleshooting guide for common issues
- Added reproducibility notes and environment setup
- Verified all code runs correctly end-to-end
- Added .github/ directory with issue templates and copilot instructions

Professional improvements:
- README follows portfolio-grade template
- Clear project description and value proposition
- Comprehensive installation and usage instructions
- Professional tone throughout (no assignment language)
- Added sections: Features, Setup, Usage, Troubleshooting, Contributing

This commit represents the transformation from "working code" to "portfolio piece". The
technical implementation was complete in step 14; this step focuses entirely on presentation,
documentation, and professional framing.

The project is now ready to showcase publicly, demonstrating both technical skills
(neural network implementation) and professional software engineering practices
(documentation, reproducibility, clean presentation).

Verification: Full end-to-end test passed. All code executes correctly. README is
comprehensive and professional. No assignment traces remain.
