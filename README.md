# Feedforward Neural Network Classifier

A PyTorch implementation for multi-class classification using feedforward neural networks.

## Overview

This project demonstrates how 2-layer feedforward neural networks can solve classification problems that are not linearly separable, using PyTorch for implementation.

## Goals

- Implement a 2-layer feedforward neural network from scratch using PyTorch
- Generate synthetic non-linearly separable data
- Train and evaluate the network
- Visualize decision boundaries

## Tech Stack

- Python 3.x
- PyTorch
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

## Setup

Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Status

🚧 Project in initial setup phase
