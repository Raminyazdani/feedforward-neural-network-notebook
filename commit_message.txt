Ramin Yazdani | Feedforward Neural Network Classifier | main | WIP(experiments): Test lower learning rate (config_1)

Experimented with a lower learning rate to understand its impact on training dynamics
and convergence behavior. This helps identify the learning rate's role in optimization.

Configuration 1 (config_1):
- Learning rate: 0.001 (10× lower than baseline)
- Hidden dimensions: 64 (same as baseline)
- Epochs: 100
- Batch size: 32

Key observations documented:
- Slower convergence compared to baseline
- More stable training with less oscillation
- Requires more epochs to reach similar performance
- Final decision boundaries similar to baseline but took longer to achieve

Analysis:
A lower learning rate makes smaller weight updates per iteration. This leads to:
- Pros: More stable training, less risk of overshooting minima
- Cons: Slower convergence, may require more training time
- Trade-off: Stability vs. speed

Comparison to baseline: While the lower learning rate is safer and more stable, it requires
more computational time to achieve similar results. For this problem, the baseline learning
rate (0.01) appears to offer a good balance between stability and convergence speed.

Verification: Training completed successfully with expected slower but stable convergence.
Decision boundaries eventually match baseline quality.
