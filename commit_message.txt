Ramin Yazdani | Feedforward Neural Network Classifier | main | WIP(deps): Add Python dependencies

Defined the project's Python dependencies in requirements.txt to ensure reproducibility
and clarify what packages are needed to run the implementation.

Added dependencies:
- torch: PyTorch framework for neural network implementation
- numpy: Numerical computing for data generation
- matplotlib: Visualization library for plots and decision boundaries
- jupyter: Interactive notebook environment

This ensures anyone can reproduce the environment needed to run the project. Each dependency
is pinned to ensure consistent behavior across different installations.

Verification: requirements.txt created with all necessary dependencies listed.
