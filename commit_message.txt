Ramin Yazdani | Feedforward Neural Network Classifier | main | WIP(visualization): Add decision boundary visualization

Implemented decision boundary plotting to visualize what the network learns. This is crucial
for understanding the model's behavior and verifying it correctly separates the three classes.

Key implementations:
- Created plot_decision_boundary() function
- Generated mesh grid covering the 2D feature space
- Color-coded classification regions for each class
- Overlaid actual training data points on the decision boundaries
- Added contour lines showing class boundaries

The visualization works by:
1. Creating a dense grid of points across the 2D space
2. Running each grid point through the trained model
3. Color-coding regions based on predicted class
4. Overlaying the actual training data as scatter points

This allows us to see:
- How well the network separates the three classes
- Whether decision boundaries are smooth or jagged
- If the network is overfitting or generalizing well
- The shape and complexity of learned boundaries

Verification: Decision boundary plot displays correctly with three distinct regions.
Boundaries visually match the non-linear class distributions in the training data.
